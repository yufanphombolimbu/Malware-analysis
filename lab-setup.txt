Please remember that while analysis malware, you must run malware on a self environment so that your physical machine must not disrupt from a running 
malware sample. Running on a host machine, your antivirus software, firewalls, Anti malware Scan Interface (AMSI) which scan a malware on a host machine, this
solutions product will not allow you to run a malware on your host machine. You must run a malware on a virtualization environment. 
Virtulization environment will run above layer of the operating system. Another great thing about virtualization is that 
your run another operating system like different windows machine, linux, and other operating system. Virtulization will really help you to understand set
up a lab. 
Only back to a topic.
For setting up lab 
You are required to have a windows machine, Linux machine, and virtulization software.
Virtulization software like Oracle Virtual Box, Microsoft hyper-v, VMWare workstation Pro or player.
You can download from this website, which I will provide a link to you.

There are tons of video out there in a youtube, medium blog how to install virtual software on a your host machine.
Now Windows machine is required for testing or running malware sample. Many cybercriminal write malware for Windows machine because more 
than 90 percentage of the global market has been shared by Microsoft PC. It is being user friendly for people so this operating system. 
So after set up a virtualbox on your local environment, then it now to set up windows machine on a virtual environment.
So I am gonna provide Windows 10 ova file Link for you. One benefit for you is that Ova file will provide 90 days license for endpoint user.
Windows 10 Ova file link

User: IEUSER
Password: Passw0rd

After you have setup virtualbox on machine. Then you must just import a ova file by double clicking it.
After double clicking it, it will take sometimes depending upon your hardware specification. 
Now installing process, has been complete then you can login into your Windows machine.
After successfulling installing windows machine, we need a ton of a tools for malware analysis. Installing
one by one tools can consume our time, in place of that we have flare-vm. Flare-VM has been maintained by 
Fire-eye. Flare-VM is designed for analysis a malware on a safely environment like a virtual box or vmware.
I will provide link of Flare-VM link below:
https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm
After installing of windows 10 machine, Open Powershell.exe must be run on 
administration so that flare-vm script can be run but powershell script will not run 
because windows by default doesn't allow to run powershell script to run.
So you need to unrestricted the policy by typing on a powershell
set-execution -bypass 
then enter 
Yes
and run a powershell script.
It will take sometimes to install packages and tools on your local machine, it can take a time depending
upon your internet connection speed. And finally flare-vm has been successfully installed on your machine then you must reboot your system.
There are ton of tools in flare-vm which help you to analyzed a malware.  
You can download malware sample from malwarebazar.com, look at lenny zelster website who is a creator of Remnux Linux another Operating system
for analyzing malware.
Now another operating system is required to analyze a malware i.e. Remnux machine.
I will provide a link to you from where you can download Remnux machine.
